// a parameter is WHAT KIND of thing that is going to be passed into the function
//an argument is the ACTUAL THING being passed into the function

//return will actually produce a value and spit it out of the function allowing other things within the program to use that value
//console.log just shows the developer what value is coming out but doesn't give that info to the program
